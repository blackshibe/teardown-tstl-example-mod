# [Teardown TypeScriptToLua Example Teleporter Mod](https://github.com/blackshibe/teardown-tstl-example-mod)

This is an example mod for Teardown written in TypeScriptToLua.

## Running the project

-   Install npm
-   Run `npm i` to update dependencies
-   Run `npm build` to build the project, or `npm watch` to make it rebuild every time a file changes
-   Done!

## Packaging

-   Run `npm build`
-   Change `transformer/comment.lua` to suit your needs - please publish your work, too! mods make great practice and editing material for new programmers!
-   Copy your assets, `info.txt`, and `main.lua` to a separate folder. any dev related folders like `src` are useless
-   Publish it. Good luck!
